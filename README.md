# Dockerised Einstein

The aim of this project is to rebuild the Einstein automated script correcting 
utility with dockers.

The project will set up a new Einstein system built around docker containers
while still using the original automated correction script.

The new system will allow other universities outside of DCU to adopt it through 
catering for various other module code semantics.
